He is the oxygen that fills my lungs
I hate it
It's silly, isn't it
To hate love
Silly and, quite sad, I think
And it's quite lonely, to not have love
Though, a peaceful type of lonely, I think
There is poetry in this
I mean, love is quite beautiful
But I think it is also quite consuming
But then again, I think too much
I hate that, too
Is a quiet mind so far out of reach?
